        <p class="text-gray-600">
            Over the past few weeks, I've received numerous questions about a particular line in the <code class="bg-gray-200 p-1 rounded-md">/etc/profile</code> configuration file that opens gay porn when you sign in. While I appreciate the community's engagement and enthusiasm, it's essential to emphasize the importance of referring to the official documentation and resources provided.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-600">
            For those who haven't checked the manual: Yes, you need to switch to a tty and carefully edit the <code class="bg-gray-200 p-1 rounded-md">/etc/profile</code> file to remove the line that opens gay porn when you sign in. Kindly remove or comment out any undesired lines to resolve the reported issue. These steps are clearly outlined in the manual, and I implore you to make it a habit to RTFM before raising a query.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-600">
            The importance of self-reliance and proactive learning cannot be overstated. Time and again, the solution lies in the documentation. So, before reaching out with questions, take a moment, review the resources at your disposal, and remember: RTFM.
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-red-600 font-bold">For any other concerns or questions, please consult the official documentation or forums. Your understanding is appreciated.</p>
